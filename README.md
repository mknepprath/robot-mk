To run:

1. Pull down the repo.
1. Get some tokens from Twitter and set them up as environment variables.
1. Run `python ebooks.py`.

To run remotely:

1. Set up Heroku's local tooling.
1. Run `heroku run worker --app robot-mk`.

Note that the canonical version should be considered the one deployed to Heroku, but the GitHub repo should also be kept up to date.
